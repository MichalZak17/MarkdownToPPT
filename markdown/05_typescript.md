title: Introduction to TypeScript
agenda: Static typing, interfaces, and advanced TS features.

# Why TypeScript?
- Solves JS problems by introducing static typing.
- Errors are detected at compile time, not at runtime.

---

# Types in TS
- Simple: `string`, `number`, `boolean`.
- Complex: `any`, `object`, `Array<T>`.
- Tuples: e.g. `[number, number]`.
