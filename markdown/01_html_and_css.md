agenda: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), page layout, HTML 5 features, and preprocessors.

# CSS Basics
- Three ways to include styles: inline, embedded, and external files.
- Syntax: `selector { property: value; }`.

---

# Selectors and Cascading
- Classes: `.class_name` for multiple elements.
- Identifiers: `#id` for a unique element.
- Pseudo-classes: `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`.

---

# Page Layout
- `<div>` blocks: Basic containers for styling.
- Flexbox: Modern positioning approach (`display: flex`).
- Grid: Grid system for advanced layouts.

# Transforms and Animations
- `transform`: rotate, translate, scale.
- `transition`: Smooth property changes over time.

---

# Preprocessors (LESS)
- Enable the use of variables (e.g. `@color: #fff;`).
- Support nesting rules and mathematical operations.
