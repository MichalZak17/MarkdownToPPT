agenda: Classes, prototypes, inheritance, and encapsulation in JS.

# Objects and Methods
- Objects are collections of properties and methods.
- A method is a property that holds a function.
- The `this` keyword refers to the current object.

---

# Prototypes and Classes
- Prototype: A fallback source of properties for objects.
- Classes (ES2015): The `class` notation for defining constructors and methods.

---

# Inheritance
- The `extends` keyword allows creating child classes.
- `super()`: Calls the parent class constructor.

---

# Errors and Exceptions
- `try ... catch`: Catching runtime errors.
- `throw new Error()`: Manually throwing exceptions.
