agenda: Language syntax, data types, variables, and control flow.
---

# Introduction to JS
- Created in 1995 to add interactivity to web pages.
- Standardized as ECMAScript.

---

# Data Types
- Number: Integers and floating-point numbers.
- String: Character sequences.
- Boolean: Logical values `true` and `false`.

---

# Variables
- `let`: Block-scoped variable declaration.
- `const`: Constant declaration that cannot be reassigned.
- Variables in JS act as pointers to values.

---

# Control Flow
- Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`.
- Loops: `while`, `do ... while`, and `for`.
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`.

---

# Regular Expressions
- Used for text searching and validation (e.g. email).
- Symbols: `^` (start), `$` (end), `\d` (digit).
