agenda: Event handling, asynchronous communication, Canvas, SVG, and WebGL.
---

# Event Handling
- `addEventListener`: Registering functions that respond to user actions (e.g. 'click').
- Propagation: Events "travel" from child elements to parents.

# Fetch API and Promises
- `fetch()`: Sending and receiving data asynchronously.
- Promise: An object representing a future event (pending, fulfilled, rejected).

---

# Graphics (Canvas and SVG)
- Canvas: Raster graphics drawn by scripts.
- SVG: Scalable vector graphics in XML format.

---

# WebGL
- Provides access to the graphics card (GPU) from the browser.
- Used for rendering advanced 3D graphics.
